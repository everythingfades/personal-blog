# lecture1
this lecture would remind us about haskell, lazy/strict evaluation

```haskell
module Intro where
```

goals of the course:

- explore different paradigms
- algorithmic thinking
- analyse performance
- mathematical modeling

```haskell
insert :: Ord a => a -> [a] -> [a]
insert x [] = [x]
insert x (y:ys) = 
  | x <= y    = x : y : ys
  | otherwise = y : insert x ys 
```

let T_insert(n) stand for the time needed to insert n

then

- T_insert(0) = 1
- T_insert(n) = 1 + T_insert(n-1)

so T_insert(n) = n + 1, it is O(n) in time, the list is O(n) in space

```haskell
isort :: Ord a => [a] => [a]
isort [] = []
isort (x:xs) = insert x (isort xs)
-- we first want xs to be sorted, so isort xs
-- we want to insert x to the sorted xs, so insert x (isort xs)
```

- T_isort(0) = 1
- T_isort(n) = 1 + T_insert(n-1) + T_isort(n-1)

so 

$\begin{aligned}
\text{T_isort}(n) &= 1 + \text{T_insert}(n-1) + \text{T_isort}(n-1)\\
&=1 + n + \text{T_isort}(n-1)\\
&= 1+n+(1+n-1) + \text{T_isort}(n-2)\\
&=n + \sum_{i=1}^{n}i\\
&=O(n^2)\end{aligned}$

we create two further functions

```haskell
head :: [a] -> a
head (x:_) = x
```

```haskell
minimum :: Ord a => [a] -> a
minimum xs = head(isort xs)
-- isort sorts the list, the head is the minimum
```

so

```haskell
minimum [3,5,2,1] = head (isort [3,5,2,1])
                  = head (insert 3 (isort [5,2,1]))
                  = head (insert 3 (insert 5 (isort [2,1])))
                  = head (insert 3 (insert 5 (insert 2 (isort [1]))))
                  = head (insert 3 (insert 5 (insert 2 (insert 1 []))))
                  = head (insert 3 (insert 5 (insert 2 (1 : ?))))
                  = head (insert 3 (insert 5 ((1 : ?))))
                  = head (insert 3 (((1 : ?))))
                  = head ((((1 : ?))))
                  = 1
```

minimum looked like $O(n^2)$ but it is $O(n)$

if haskell is a strict language, then minimum is $O(n^2)$

if the algorithm looked at every part of the data, then there is no difference between lazy and strict

if haskell is lazy

```haskell
head (repeat 42) = head (42 : repeat 42) 
                 = 42
```

if haskell is strict

```haskell
head (repeat 42) = head (42 : repeat 42) 
                 = head (42 : 42 : 42 : ...)
```

## Normal Forms
lazy stuff are in WHNF(Weak-Head Normal Form), strict stuff are in NF(Normal Form)

this is usually defined in terms of the lambda calculus
